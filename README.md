## About
This programs generates a random colour with hex and rgb code!

This is my 2nd program in C# so there might be bugs...

## Known bugs
Sometimes when opening the program it says: "Windows protected your pc" idk what it is on mac

It only says that becuase the publisher is unknown and idk how to fix that
