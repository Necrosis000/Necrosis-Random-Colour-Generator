## About
This programs generates a random colour with hex and rgb code!

This is my 2nd program in C# so there might be bugs...

## Known bugs
Sometimes when opening the program it says: "Windows protected your pc" idk what it is on mac

It only says that becuase the publisher is unknown and idk how to fix that

Google chrome also says that the file might be dangerous (idk why)

## Other Versions
